# Google Sheets Day to Month Converter 📅

[!NOTE]
This project contains a **Google Apps Script** associated to a personalized **Google Sheets** (which I won't be providing in full, rather just the bare minimum for context), which objective is to normalize dates that have been entered in argentinian format (`DD/MM/YYYY`) so that internal **Google Sheets functions** can correctly operate.
